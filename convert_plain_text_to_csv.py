# This script reads a specified .txt file from stdin
# and outputs a corresponding .csv file to stdout
# 
# The CSV file will contain (N*copies), and represent
# N copies of the route slip.  That way it is possible
# to print extra copies of the route slip without 
# using up an extra sheet of paper for every extra copy.
#
# Usage: 
#
#   python <some_route_slip_file.txt >some_route_slip_file.csv
